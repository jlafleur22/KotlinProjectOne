# Overview

I started this project in order to learn about and how to work in the Kotlin language.

The code from this project, similar to a Java project I created, is a recipe converter; A converter that allows you to
convert your recipes from metric measurements to imperial, or imperial to metric. I was able to take that basic idea,
and with Kotlin, create a much more robust and useful program that solved some of the problems I was having in Java
making this project more readable and functional.

# Development Environment

I used intelli-J for writing and compiling this code. You can download it for windows devices from jetbrains.com
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows). Intelli-J is a powerful, easy to use program with
very helpful debugging tools. I used the Kotlin language to create this program

# Future Work

* fix auto indent for first lines of a new paragraph when writing a new text file
* fix rounding to be more userfriendly in outputs.
* Add ui so that a text entry form and buttons handle the input/execute portion of the program.
